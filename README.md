# Cricket Shot Intent Inference 

## Objective 
  `` • To classify batsman shots into energy levels from clips using pose landmarks, while building a modular framework ``
  
  ``• To develop a system to quantify batsman’s energy, intent by analyzing body motion, aiding bowlers in strategies``


## Pre processing 

**1. Match Recording**
> Recorded 120+ hrs of cricket match and Used cvlib-based person detection algorithm to extract 2000+ relavant clips from raw video input
